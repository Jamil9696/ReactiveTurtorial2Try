  /* The subscription is the link between the publisher and the subscriber.
     the onSubscribe Method is used by the subscriber to get a subscription from a publisher
     and communicate through the subscription with the publisher. The subscriber communicates with the publisher by asking the p√ºublisher
     to get values from it. So the publisher is not pushing values to the subscription but the subscriber requests values through the subscription (back pressure).
     Back pressure means that the subscriber only gets that amount of events that they can process and
     the publisher can not know which amount of events the consumer can process. that's why the consumer instead of the publisher always request data
